# Introduction

## About

The __Ultimate Kotlin Workshop__ guides you implementing a basic ReST webservice using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 
programming language and the [Spring](https://spring.io/) framework.
It will provide a JSON API to manage accounts and transfer money between them.
All of that will be persisted in an in-memory database using the Java Persistence API (JPA) and 
an object-relational mapper called [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) under the hood.
If time permits we will also introduce a basic, custom security layer protecting our API.

Its target audience are developers with basic experience in any object oriented programming language 
(preferably Java, C# or Ruby, Python, ...) and general web development (HTTP, ReST, JSON).

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools prepared on your computer to be able to follow the workshop:

1. [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (the free community edition is sufficient)
1. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) (tool to build the app)
