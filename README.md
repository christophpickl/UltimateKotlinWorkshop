# Introduction

## About

The __Ultimate Kotlin Workshop__ guides you implementing a basic ReST webservice using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
and [Spring](https://spring.io/) framework. It will provide a JSON API to manage accounts and transfer money between them.
All of that will be persisted in an in-memory database using JPA+Hibernate as the ORM (object-relational mapping).
If time permits, we will also introduce a basic, custom security layer protecting our API.

It's target audience are developers with basic background experience in object oriented programming 
(preferably Java, C# or similar) and web development (HTTP, ReST).

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools prepared on your machine to be able to follow the workshop:

1. [Java 8 SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (9 will also do just fine)
1. [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Community edition)
1. Gradle bin ???

Optional:

1. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) ReST client to test your API manually
